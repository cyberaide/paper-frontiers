  abstract =      {With machine learning (ML) becoming a transformative
                   tool for science, the scientific community needs a
                   clear catalogue of ML techniques, and their relative
                   benefits on various scientific problems, if they were
                   to make significant advances in science using AI.
                   Although this comes under the purview of
                   benchmarking, conventional benchmarking initiatives
                   are focused on performance, and as such, science,
                   often becomes a secondary criteria.},
