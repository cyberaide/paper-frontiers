abstract="In order to satisfy the need for sophisticated experiment and simulation management solutions for the scientific user community, various frameworks must be provided. Such frameworks include APIs, services, templates, patterns, GUIs, command-line tools, and workflow systems that are specifically addressed towards the goal of assisting in the complex process of experiment and simulation management. Workflow by itself is just one of the ingredients for a successful experiment and simulation management tool.",
